# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Saved panels: a named, reusable set of targets defined in a `panels.toon` file, referenced by
  `panel="..."` on `consensus`, `debate`, and `review` instead of spelling out the targets each
  call (with optional one-off `panel_overrides`). Panels are discovered across
  `$RUTHERFORD_CONFIG_DIR`, `<cwd>/.rutherford/`, and `~/.rutherford/` and merged by name, the
  closest scope winning a name collision -- the same precedence the TOML config uses for a project
  `rutherford.toml` over the global `config.toml`. Files are TOON, read through the serialization
  seam (which gained a `decode` counterpart to `encode`). Loading is lazy and cached; a new
  `reload_panels` tool re-reads edits without a restart. Panel files are validated at load, with
  every problem (bad TOON, unknown CLI, malformed target) reported in one pass rather than failing
  on the first. New error codes `PANEL_NOT_FOUND` and `PANEL_INVALID`.
- A `debate` tool: several targets argue a question across multiple rounds and return the full
  transcript. Round one is each voice's independent answer; every later round shows a voice the
  other voices' latest positions and asks it to rebut and revise, so the panel actually argues
  instead of answering in isolation. The result's `rounds` hold every voice's answer at every
  round, so the discussion is fully retraceable -- the verbose record that a one-shot `consensus`
  drops. A voice that fails a round is recorded and falls out; the debate stops early once fewer
  than two voices remain. Optional `stances` keep a voice arguing for/against throughout, and an
  optional closing `synthesize` pass (on by default) states where the panel converged. The new
  `max_debate_rounds` config field (default 4) caps the rounds; the per-call `max_targets` cap
  bounds the panel.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- `doctor` and `capabilities` no longer report a Bedrock-configured Claude Code or Codex as
  `needs_login`. When a CLI is pointed at a third-party cloud backend (AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex,
  Bedrock Mantle), its credential is an AWS/GCP chain rather than an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` or a native login session, so the old API-key/session probe gave a false
  negative.
  - The `claude_code` adapter now reads the JSON body of `claude auth status`. A third-party
    `apiProvider` / `authMethod` (or a `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*` switch) reports `unknown`, so `doctor`'s
    live round trip confirms real reachability instead of trusting a "configured" flag.
  - The `codex` adapter now consults `codex doctor --json` and trusts its `auth.credentials` check,
    which validates the effective credential -- including the built-in `amazon-bedrock` provider.
  Both adapters fall back to the previous env-key / persisted-session markers when those commands
  are unavailable on an older CLI.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- The README logo image and the links to `docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE` now use
  absolute GitHub URLs, so they render and resolve on the PyPI project page. Relative paths only
  work on the GitHub repository view.

### Changed

- The GitHub Release attaches only the built wheel and sdist; a `.gitignore` byproduct that
  `uv build` writes into `dist/` is no longer uploaded as an asset.

### Removed

- A stray `.antigravitycli/` working directory the Antigravity CLI left in the repo during local
  verification and that was committed by accident. It is now gitignored. Only a symlink path was
  ever tracked -- no credential or file contents.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-30

Initial release.

### Added

- Interface-driven orchestration core. The services depend only on the abstract
  `CLIAdapter` and `ProcessRunner` interfaces; every CLI-specific detail lives behind an
  adapter, so adding or removing a CLI is additive.
- Eight CLI adapters: `claude_code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `qwen`, `antigravity`, `kiro`,
  `opencode`, `goose`, plus a config-driven generic adapter so a well-behaved further CLI is a
  config entry.
- The MCP tool surface: `delegate`, `consensus`, `review`, `plan`, `capabilities`,
  `doctor`, `job_status`, `job_result`, and `list_roles`, exposed over stdio via FastMCP.
- A universal `SafetyMode` (`read_only` | `propose` | `write` | `yolo`), defaulting to
  `read_only`, mapped per adapter to that CLI's approval and sandbox flags. Write and yolo
  modes require explicit opt-in and a trusted-workspace check.
- Synchronous and background (job) execution, with parallel consensus across targets and
  optional per-target stance steering.
- Normalized `DelegationResult` envelope and a stable set of string error codes, serialized
  as TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) to cut MCP client token usage, behind a swappable
  serialization seam.
- Cross-platform process execution (Windows, macOS, Linux, and Linux under WSL): argv arrays
  with no shell strings, `PATHEXT`/`.cmd` resolution, process-tree termination on timeout,
  and Windows<->WSL path translation.
- A delegation depth guard propagated through `RUTHERFORD_DEPTH`, plus a per-request target
  cap, so a CLI-calls-itself chain is bounded.
- Versioned role personas (`planner`, `codereviewer`, `security`, `debugger`) loaded from
  markdown.
- Fake-based unit tests, adapter golden tests, a shared contract test over every registered
  adapter, the self-invocation depth-guard test, and a local-only integration suite (real
  CLIs, skipped in CI). The full house-convention scaffolding and docs set.
